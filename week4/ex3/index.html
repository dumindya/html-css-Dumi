            <h3>Who is a web developer?</h3>
            <p>A Web developer is a kind of programmer who specializes in the development of applications relating to the World Wide Web or distributed network applications, which typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client browser using associated programming languages like HTML/CSS, C#, Ruby and PHP to name a few. A Web developer is usually concerned with the back end or the programming aspect of creating a website or Web application and is not to be confused with a Web designer, who only deals with the aesthetics of a website or application, although many professionals have both skill sets.</p>

            <h3>What are the qualifications you need to be a web developer?</h3>
            <h4>Languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4>
            <p>It’s impossible to go into a career in web development if you’re not fluent in these three core languages. HTML is the language used to create websites and apps; you’ll use it to describe the structure of the page. CSS is used to describe the visual presentation of these pages, determining things like layout, colors and fonts. JavaScript is used to make these pages interactive. These aren’t the only programming languages—you can find a guide to the 10 most popular languages here—but they are the most useful for beginners.</p>
            <h4>Libraries and Frameworks: Bootstrap and jQuery</h4>
            <p>Once you’ve mastered the basic languages, you can start exploring libraries and frameworks—which have essentially been created to simplify and speed-up the way you work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are tons of libraries and frameworks out there, but Bootstrap and jQuery are the most popular, so knowing these two will give you a huge advantage.A free, open-source front-end library containing HTML and CSS-based design templates, Bootstrap will enable you to create responsive, mobile-friendly websites that display flawlessly on any device. Now remember the programming language JavaScript? Well, jQuery is simply a JavaScript library. In very basic terms, jQuery condenses common JavaScript tasks into fewer lines of code. If you want a more in-depth look at it, we’ve elaborated the differences between the two.</p>
